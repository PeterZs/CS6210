1. Linux Platform
   
   I implemented this project on RedHat 6.4.

2. Preemptive scheduler implementation

   Every thread has a fair share of CPU time. When time is up, the current tcb'll be cycled to the tail of ready queue.
   In my implementation, no tcb'll be removed from queue. When a tcb finishes, it'll only be logically marked as completed.

3. How to compile

   Simply typing the "make" command in the terminal will produce "Proc" executable file and “gtthread.a” library in current directory. 
   NOTE: When compiling with test cases, please include header file in the form of #include "gtthread.h". Do NOT include
         header file in the form of #include <gtthread.h>, because the header resides in current directory.

4. Strategy of preventing deadlock in dining philosophers

   Simple strategy: Never let philosopher take last chopstick if no hungry philosopher has two chopsticks afterwards.
